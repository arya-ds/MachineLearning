# Classification Model 
Domain : Banking Industry  , Data : Bank Loans 

In this project i have analysed the dataset and peformed EDA analysis and data visualization

I have performed datacleaning , data processing and feature engineering techniques to prepare data for modelling 

Processed data is fed into various classification models to get improved accuracy score 

Stacking technique applied to compare various model results and choose the best model 

Performed feature importance to identify top features contributing the model accuracy .

Used Eli5, Lime, SHAP model to provide model interpretability and features contributing the most.
