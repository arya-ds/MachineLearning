This notebook covers Classification modelling with Imbalance output class
I have presented various techniques that can be used to handle imbalance class and get better results
techniques used :
- Exploratory data anlaysis
- class weight=Balanced
- upsampling minority class
- Stratify
-SMOTE

As we see various metrics under each technique , SMOTE gives best results
